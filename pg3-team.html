      <h1>TEAM</h1>
      <p> 
        While giving viewers a taste of what business is 
        like from every corner of the office, Mad Men focuses 
        on Don Draper, a talented creative director with a 
        troubled past and Peggy Olsen, an ambitious secretary 
        turned copywriting chief. The plot explores the 
        shifting moods and social conventions of the 1960's- 
        including presidential campaigns, war and human rights, 
        and weaves them into the characters’ daily business environment. 
       It provides a glimpse into the dynamics of work culture during that era, 
       particularly in the advertising industry. Meanwhile in the office, each character is plagued by 
        their own demons.

    <div class="panel">
      <p>Donald Francis "Don" Draper is a founding partner and the Creative Director at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce Advertising Agency in Manhattan, NY ("Shut the Door. Have a Seat"). Prior to that position, he was the Director of the Creative Department at the Sterling Cooper Advertising Agency ("Smoke Gets in Your Eyes"). He is regarded among his colleagues as the best to ever pitch copy. His true name is Richard "Dick" Whitman. He stole the identity of a dead officer during the Korean War.
        
        when we first met Don, the protagonist of the acclaimed television series Mad Men, we met a man who had it all. He was at the pinnacle of his career, happily married to his gorgeous wife, Betty, father of two adorable children, and living in a big house in one of the fanciest suburbs of Westchester. His haughty, arrogant, and aloof facade was easily mistaken for genuine confidence.

        We soon found out, however, that Don was a man with many flaws. An alcoholic, a womanizer, and an adulterer, he lied about things, not the least of which was his identity. These flaws, or “symptoms” as I think of them, were an indication that something in Don was unwell. Symptoms are often brilliant clues that let an individual know they have underlying yet blocked emotions, often from the past, that need attention and release.

    <button class="accordion">PEGGY OLSEN </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Margaret "Peggy" Olson is an employee at Sterling Cooper Advertising Agency who starts out as Don Draper's secretary.
        She later gets promoted as copywriter, the first female to hold such position since World War 2. Peggy later accepts 
        the position of Copy Chief at Cutler, Gleason, and Chaough.
        Peggy was born May 25, 1939 to a Roman Catholic Norwegian and Irish-American family 
        and grew up at Bay Ridge in Brooklyn, New York. When she was 12 years old, her father died of a heart attack 
        in front of her. She has a sister named Anita. Shortly after graduating from the Miss Deaver's, a "topnotch" 
        secretarial school in Brooklyn, Peggy started her career as secretary to Don Draper, the creative director at Sterling Cooper.

    <button class="accordion">ROGER STERLING</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Roger Sterling, Jr. is a senior partner and accounts executive 
        at Sterling Cooper Advertising Agency in Manhattan, NY, a position 
        he inherited from his father Roger Sterling, Sr., who founded the 
        agency with Bertram Cooper in 1923. Roger was born in 1916 and is the son 
        of Sterling Cooper co-founder Roger Sterling Sr. Because of this, 
        Roger grew up in considerable wealth and status. As a child he had a German nanny 
        who was fired after the Lindbergh baby kidnapping in 1932. Roger was subsequently 
        raised by another nanny named Belva, whom he loved dearly. Always nautically minded, 
        he claims to have sailed a tramp steamer to Hilton Head as a young man, though it 
        was later revealed to have been a yacht.
        As he often mentions, Sterling is a World War II Naval veteran. 
        Prior to his deployment to the South Pacific, he was in an intense 
        relationship with Anabelle Mathis, heiress to the Caldecott Farms dog food company. 
        She ended their affair shortly before he shipped out, leaving Roger devastated.

  <h4> The supporting cast of "Mad Men" was an incredibly talented and interesting group
    of actors and characters who played a crucial role in making the show a critical 
    and commercial success. While the series was primarily centered around the enigmatic 
    character of Don Draper, portrayed by Jon Hamm, the supporting cast added depth 
    and complexity to the world of Sterling Cooper, a Madison Avenue advertising 
    agency in the 1960s.
